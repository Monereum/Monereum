Our  team of crypto enthusiasts announced that the Monereum chain will be kept and running after the Monero hard fork scheduled for the 1th of November  2019 at block #1961130.

Monereum is an Ethereum-based distributed ledger protocol with transaction/contract privacy and special consensus mechanisms.

Monereum is based on [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) and is updated in line with go-ethereum releases.

Web-Site: https://monereum.live

Telegram Channel: https://t.me/Monereum

Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/Monereum

Github: https://github.com/Monereum 

Airdrop bot: https://t.me/Monereumbot

Key enhancements over go-ethereum:

* __Privacy__ - Monereum supports private transactions and private contracts through public/private state separation, and utilises peer-to-peer encrypted message exchanges (see [Constellation](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/constellation) and [Tessera](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/tessera)) for directed transfer of private data to network participants
* __Alternative Consensus Mechanisms__ - with no need for POW/POS in a permissioned network, Quorum instead offers multiple consensus mechanisms that are more appropriate for consortium chains:
    * __Raft-based Consensus__ - a consensus model for faster blocktimes, transaction finality, and on-demand block creation
    * __Istanbul BFT__ - a PBFT-inspired consensus algorithm with transaction finality, by AMIS.
* __Peer Permissioning__ - node/peer permissioning using smart contracts, ensuring only known parties can join the network
* __Higher Performance__ - Quorum offers significantly higher performance than public geth

## Specifications

ðŸ“Œ Coin Supply - 298,693,496 MNR

ðŸ“Œ Circulating Supply at Hard Fork - ~ 17,3 Million MNR

ðŸ“Œ Consensus - 3 (Raft CFT, Istanbul pBFT, Clique POA Consensus)

ðŸ“Œ Algorithm - Ethash

ðŸ“Œ Block Time - ~ Every 20 seconds

ðŸ“Œ Block Reward -  Minimum of 6 MNR per block

ðŸ“Œ Block Size - Dynamic

ðŸ“Œ Privacy - Ring signature / stealth addresses

## Reporting Security Bugs
Security is part of our commitment to our users. At Quorum we have a close relationship with the security community, we understand the realm, and encourage security researchers to become part of our mission of building secure reliable software. This section explains how to submit security bugs, and what to expect in return.

If you have not received a reply to your email or you have not heard from the security team please contact any team member through quorum slack security channel. **Please note that Quorum slack channels are public discussion forum**. When escalating to this medium, please do not disclose the details of the issue. Simply state that you're trying to reach a member of the security team.

#### Responsible Disclosure Process
Monereum project uses the following responsible disclosure process:

- Once the security report is received it is assigned a primary handler. This person coordinates the fix and release process.
- The issue is confirmed and a list of affected software is determined.
- Code is audited to find any potential similar problems.
- If it is determined, in consultation with the submitter, that a CVE-ID is required, the primary handler will trigger the process.
- Fixes are applied to the public repository and a new release is issued.
- On the date that the fixes are applied, announcements are sent to Quorum-announce.
- At this point you would be able to disclose publicly your finding.

**Note:** This process can take some time. Every effort will be made to handle the security bug in as timely a manner as possible, however it's important that we follow the process described above to ensure that disclosures are handled consistently.  

#### Receiving Security Updates
The best way to receive security announcements is to subscribe to the Quorum-announce mailing list/channel. Any messages pertaining to a security issue will be prefixed with **[security]**.
